# 📘 SYSTEMS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS – COMPLETE NOTES

A **system of linear equations** is a collection of two or more linear equations involving the same variables. The solution of the system is the set of values that satisfies **all the equations simultaneously**.

For systems with two variables, each equation represents a straight line on a graph, and the solution corresponds to the **point of intersection of the lines** 📍.

Such systems are widely used in **engineering 🔧, economics 💰, physics ⚙️, computer science 💻, and business applications**.

Depending on the nature of the equations, a system can have:

- ✅ **One unique solution** (intersecting lines)
- ❌ **No solution** (parallel lines)
- ♾️ **Infinitely many solutions** (coincident lines)

Two important algebraic techniques used to solve these systems are:

1. **Elimination Method**
2. **Matrix Method**

## 🔹 1. ELIMINATION METHOD – DEFINITION & EXAMPLES ✏️

### ✅ Definition

The **elimination method** is a systematic technique used to solve a system of linear equations by **eliminating one variable at a time** through addition or subtraction of equations.

### 🎯 Core Idea

Make the coefficients of one variable **equal or opposite** so that adding or subtracting the equations cancels that variable automatically.

### 📝 Steps

1. Write equations in standard form:  
   a1x + b1y = c1
   a2x + b2y = c2

2. Multiply equations (if necessary) to make coefficients equal.
3. Add or subtract to eliminate one variable.
4. Solve for the remaining variable.
5. Substitute the value back into any original equation.
6. Write the solution as an ordered pair `(x, y)`.

---

### ✅ Example 1: Infinitely Many Solutions ♾️

Solve:
2x + y = 5
2x + y = 5

Subtracting the equations:  
(2x + y) - (2x + y) = 5 - 5
0 = 0

**Conclusion:** Infinitely many solutions (coincident lines)

---

### ✅ Example 2: Unique Solution ✅

Solve:  
x + y = 10
x - y = 2

Step 1: Add the equations

(x + y) + (x - y) = 10 + 2
2x = 12
x = 6

Step 2: Substitute x = 6

6 + y = 10
y = 4

**Final Answer:** `(6, 4)`

---

### ✅ Example 3: Multiplication Required ✖️

Solve:
3x + 2y = 11
4x + 2y = 14

Step 1: Subtract the equations

(4x + 2y) - (3x + 2y) = 14 - 11
x = 3

Step 2: Substitute x = 3

9 + 2y = 11
2y = 2
y = 1

**Final Answer:** `(3, 1)`

---

## 🔹 2. MATRIX METHOD – DEFINITION & EXAMPLES 📊

### ✅ Definition

The **matrix method** represents a system of linear equations using **matrices** and solves them by:

- Finding the **inverse of a matrix**, or
- Using **row operations (Gauss or Gauss–Jordan elimination)**.

---

### 📐 Matrix Representation

System:
ax + by = c
dx + ey = f

Matrix form:

A \* X = B

Where:
A = [[a, b],
[d, e]]
X = [[x],
[y]]
B = [[c],
[f]]

If A⁻¹ exists:

X = A⁻¹ \* B

### ⭐ Importance

- Efficient for **large systems**
- Used in **AI 🤖, machine learning, engineering, and scientific computing**
- Helps determine **rank, consistency, and nature of solutions**

---

### ✅ Example 1: Inverse Matrix Method

Solve:
x + y = 5
2x + 3y = 11

Matrices:

A = [[1, 1],
[2, 3]]
B = [[5],
[11]]

Determinant:

|A| = 13 - 12 = 1

Inverse of A:

A⁻¹ = [[3, -1],
[-2, 1]]

Solution:

X = A⁻¹ _ B
= [[3, -1],
[-2, 1]] _ [[5],
[11]]
= [[4],
[1]]

**Answer:** `x = 4, y = 1`

---

### ✅ Example 2: Augmented Matrix (Gauss Method)

Solve:

x + 2y = 7
3x + 2y = 11

Augmented matrix:

[1 2 | 7]
[3 2 | 11]

Row operation: R2 → R2 - 3\*R1

[1 2 | 7]
[0 -4 | -10]

Solve for y:

y = -10 / -4 = 5/2

Substitute in first equation:

x + 2\*(5/2) = 7
x = 2

**Answer:** `(2, 5/2)`

---

### ✅ Example 3: No Solution ❌

Solve:

2x + y = 4
4x + 2y = 10

Augmented matrix:

[2 1 | 4]
[4 2 | 10]

Row operation: R2 → R2 - 2\*R1

[2 1 | 4]
[0 0 | 2]

This gives:

0x + 0y = 2

**Conclusion:** No solution → Parallel lines

## ✅ Summary

- **Elimination Method:** Simple for 2×2 or 3×3 systems
- **Matrix / Inverse Method:** Efficient for large systems and computational solutions
- Helps determine **solution type**: unique, infinite, or none
